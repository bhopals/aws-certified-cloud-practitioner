### AWS offers:
 - on-demand, 
 - pay-as-you-go,  
 - reservation-based payment models,


There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: 
- compute, 
- storage,  
- outbound data transfer

These characteristics vary somewhat, depending on the AWS product and pricing model you choose.
In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS
services within the same region. There are some exceptions, so be sure to verify data transfer rates
before beginning.


AWS offers several pricing models depending on product. These include:
- On Demand means you pay for compute or database capacity with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.
- Dedicated Instances (available with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)) run in a 
	virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that’s dedicated to a single customer.
- Spot Instances are an Amazon EC2 pricing mechanism that lets you purchase spare computing
	capacity with no upfront commitment at discounted hourly rates.
- Reservations provide you with the ability to receive a greater discount, up to 75 percent, by
	paying for capacity ahead of time. More det



### Pricing models for Amazon EC2:
 - On demand : Pay as you go
 - Spot Instance : 90% discount to On-Demand Instance pricing
 - Reservation Instance : 75% discount to On-Demand Instance pricing
 - Dedicated  - dedicated so not much cost benefits, but ( it allows you to use server-bound software licenses to meet the compliances)

### Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

IOPS - Input Output Per Seconds

 - SSD-backed volumes are optimized for transactional workloads involving frequent read/write 
 	operations with small I/O size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS.
 - HDD-backed volumes are optimized for large streaming workloads where throughput
	(measured in megabits per second) is a better performance measure than IOPS.
